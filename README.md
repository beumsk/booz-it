# Booz-it
Booz-it is a drinking game based on turn by turn rules arriving and selecting players randomly.
There are several rules that will give you the opportunity to share drinks or take some.
Keep in mind to drink responsibly. Adapt the number of drinks to your habits and state.

## Add rules in the code by contributing
The rules are listed at the end of the script.js file in an array of objects called **instructionsLibrary**.
You must follow this syntax:
```js
// nr is the number of player for this rule
// sips is the number of sips at stake
// text is the rule instruction
{nr: 0, sips: 3, text: ""}
```
Create a pull request and your new rule-s will be reviewed.
